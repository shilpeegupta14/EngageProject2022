# Face Recog iOS 15 App
![alt text](https://github.com/shilpeegupta14/images/blob/main/FACE%20RECOG.png?raw=true)
 	            
## Overview:
A face recognition app that recognises the emotion from your face
and recommends songs according to your mood. The user can 
also play recommended songs. After recognising, 
face analysis is shown in a Dashboard that tells the 
percentage of emotions like happy, sad, angry etc recognised 
from the face.

The app shows a prototype of categorising similar faces like 
avatars from the already given bunch of images through Azure's 
face API. 
The app also allows safe transaction by autofilling the card 
details. It scans the card details and presents 
the details from your credit card into the text field.  
By no means the app stores your credit card 
credentials.
